These files are the observed values for the two and five-pool model that are defined by temperature intervals from ramped pyrolysis oxidation. Due to large age estimates for each soil horizon we included the mean, min, max of each soil horizon in the dataset to be estimated by the model. Time is defined as the soil age horizon estimate. The first and second pool in mg C per g dry sediment is defined in C1 and C2, respectively. A unique identifier for each soil horizon (ID) was provided, which each have a min (REP=1), mean (REP=2), max(REP=3) age estimate.
